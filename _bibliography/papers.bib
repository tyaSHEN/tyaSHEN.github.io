  title={Dynamics of Health Expectancy: An Introduction to the Multiple Multistate Method (MMM)},
  author={Shen, Tianyu and Payne, Collin F. and Maria Jahromi},
  abstract={Many studies have compared individual measures of health expectancy across older populations by time-invariant characteristics. However, very few have included time-varying variables when calculating health expectancy. Even among older adults, socioeconomic and demographic characteristics are likely to change over the life course, and these changes may have substantial implications for health outcomes. This paper proposes a multiple multistate method (MMM) that situates the multistate model within the broader family of vector autoregressive models. Our approach allows the incorporation of the coevolution of multiple life course factors and provides a flexible yet simple way to model two or more time-varying variables with the multistate model. We demonstrate the MMM in two empirical applications, showing the flexibility of the approach to explore health expectancies with complex state spaces.},

  title={Decomposition of Differentials in Health Expectancies From Multistate Life Tables: A Research Note},
  author={Shen, Tianyu and Riffe, Tim and Payne, Collin F. and Canudas-Romo, Vladimir},
  abstract={Multistate modeling is a commonly used method to compute healthy life expectancy. However, there is currently no analytical method to decompose the components of differentials in summary measures calculated from multistate models. In this research note, we propose a derivative-based method to decompose the differentials in population-based health expectancies estimated via a multistate model into two main components: the proportion resulting from differences in initial health structure and the proportion resulting from differences in health transitions. We illustrate the method using data on activities of daily living from the U.S. Health and Retirement Study to decompose the sex differential in disability-free life expectancy (HLE) among older Americans. Our results suggest that the sex gap in HLE results primarily from differences in transition rates between disability states rather than from the initial health distribution of female and male populations. The methods introduced here will enable researchers, including those working in fields other than health, to decompose the relative contribution of initial population structure and transition probabilities to differences in state-specific life expectancies from multistate models.},

  title={Disability and morbidity among US birth cohorts, 1998–2018: A multidimensional test of dynamic equilibrium theory},
  author={Shen, Tianyu and Payne, Collin},
  abstract={A substantial body of prior research has explored patterns of disability-free and morbidity-free life expectancy among older populations. However, these distinct facets of later-life health are almost always studied in isolation, even though they are very likely to be related. Using data from the US Health and Retirement Study and a multistate life table approach, this paper explores the interactions between disability, morbidity, and mortality by sex and education among four successive US birth cohorts, born from 1914 to 1923 to 1944–1953 and compared in the periods 1998–2008 and 2008–2018. We find little compression of disability but a marked expansion of morbidity across cohorts. However, disability-free life expectancy (DFLE) among those living with chronic morbidities has increased, even though at the population-level DFLE is largely unchanged. Broadly, these patterns suggest that successive cohorts of older populations in the US are experiencing a dynamic equilibrium, where the link between chronic morbidities and disability has weakened over successive cohorts. Investigating patterns by educational attainment, we find marked disparities where the least educated individuals not only live significantly fewer years free of disabilities or chronic morbidities but also have experienced an expansion in morbidity and disability. Our findings suggest that the future trajectory of disability-free life expectancy in the US is increasingly contingent on efforts to improve disease management and control the severe consequences of chronic morbidities.},

  title={The estimation of age and sex profiles for international migration amongst countries in the Asia-Pacific region},
  author={Shen, Tianyu and Raymer, James and Qing, Guan and Wiśniowski, Arkadiusz},
  abstract={Information on the age and sex patterns of international migration occurring amongst countries in the Asia-Pacific region is important for researchers and policymakers to understand the contributions of migration towards demographic, economic and social changes. However, despite its importance, statistics on the age and sex patterns are largely absent and, where they do exist, there are considerable differences in measurement and data collection procedures. In this study, we develop a methodology for indirectly estimating the age and sex patterns of international migration for 53 populations in the Asia-Pacific region and four macroworld regions. Multiplicative component models are used to systematically combine information from multiple data sources and infer missing data, resulting in complete and harmonised tables of migration by origin, destination, age, and sex from 2000 to 2019. The estimates are presented and assessed with some discussions on how they may be applied and further improved.},

  title={The contribution of survival to changes in the net reproduction rate},
  author={Shen, Tianyu and Lazzari, Ester and Canudas-Romo, Vladimir},
  abstract={The net reproduction rate (NRR) is an alternative fertility measure to the more common total fertility rate (TFR) and accounts for the mortality context of the population studied. This study is the first to compare NRR trends in high- and low-income countries and to decompose NRR changes over time into fertility and survival components. The results show that changes in the NRR have been driven mostly by changes in fertility. Yet improvements in survival have also played an important role in explaining changes in the NRR over the last century and represent a substantial component of change in some low-income countries today. Furthermore, the decomposition of the survival component by age indicates that the survival effect on population reproduction is concentrated mostly in infancy, although the HIV/AIDS epidemic altered this age profile in some populations. The findings highlight the importance of mortality’s effect on reproduction in specific periods and contexts.},

  title={The Components of Change in Population Growth Rates},
  author={Canudas-Romo, Vladimir and Shen, Tianyu and Payne, Collin F.},
  abstract={The demographic balance equation relates the population growth rate with crude rates of fertility, mortality, and net migration. All these rates refer to changes occurring between two time points, say, t and t + h. However, this fundamental balance equation overlooks the contribution of historical fertility, mortality, and migration in explaining these population counts. Because of this, the balance equation only partially explains a change in growth rate between time t and t + h as it does not include the contribution of historical population trends in shaping the population at time t. The overall population growth rate can also be expressed as the weighted average of age-specific growth rates. In this article, we develop a method to decompose the historical drivers of current population growth by recursively employing the variable-r method on the population's average age-specific growth rates. We illustrate our method by identifying the unique contributions of survival progress, migration change, and fertility decline for current population growth in Denmark, England and Wales, France, and the United States. Our results show that survival progress is mainly having an effect on population growth at older ages, although accounting for indirect historical effects illuminates additional contributions at younger ages. Migration is particularly important in Denmark and England and Wales. Finally, we find that across all populations studied, historical fertility decline plays the largest role in shaping recent reductions in population growth rates.},

  title={Estimating international migration flows for the Asia-Pacific region: Application of a generation–distribution model},
  author={Raymer, James and Guan, Qing and Shen, Tianyu and Wiśniowski, Arkadiusz and Pietsch, Juliet},
  abstract={Flows of international migration are needed in the Asia-Pacific region to understand the patterns and corresponding effects on demographic, social, and economic change across sending and receiving countries. A major challenge to this understanding is that nearly all of the countries in this region do not gather or produce statistics on flows of international migration. The only information that are widely available represent immigrant population stocks measured at specific points in time—but these represent poor proxies for annual movements. In this paper, we present a methodology for indirectly estimating annual flows of international migration amongst 53 populations in the Asia-Pacific region and four macro world regions from 2000 to 2019 using a generation–distribution framework. The estimates suggest that 27–31 million persons from the Asia-Pacific region have changed their countries of usual residence during each year in the study. Southern Asia is estimated to have had the largest inflows and outflows, whilst intra-regional migration and return migration were highest in Eastern, Southern, and South-Eastern Asia. India, China, and Indonesia were estimated to have had the largest emigration flows and net migration losses. As a first attempt to estimate international migration flows in the Asia-Pacific region, this paper provides a basis for understanding the dynamics and complexity of the large-scale migration occurring in the region.},

  title={The role of reductions in old-age mortality in old-age population growth},
  author={Canudas-Romo, Vladimir and Shen, Tianyu and Payne, Collin},
  abstract={BACKGROUND: The variable-r model provides demographers with a way to explore the contributions of demographic components (fertility, mortality, migration) to changes in populations' age structures. However, traditional variable-r methods require extremely long mortality series to explore growth at oldest-old ages. OBJECTIVE: Our goal is to disentangle the old-age growth rate into two main components: the growth rate at some younger age, and reductions in mortality between the younger and older ages. METHODS: We focus on an adaptation of the variable-r model that can use shorter mortality series to explore population growth between two ages. RESULTS: Using data from the Human Mortality Database, we explore how these two components are driving the growth rate of 100-year-olds. Observed growth of those reaching age 100 results primarily from the high growth rates when those cohorts were 80-year-olds, and from time reductions in cohort mortality between ages 80 and 100. However, the latter component behaves differently across populations, with some countries experiencing recent slowdowns in cohort mortality declines or increases in mortality between ages 80 and 100. CONCLUSIONS: We find great diversity in the level of old-age mortality improvements across populations, and heterogeneity in the drivers of these improvements. Our findings highlight the need to closely monitor the underlying reasons for the changes in old-age mortality across populations and time. CONTRIBUTION: We present illustrations of the use of the variable-r method to monitor demographic change in an online interactive application, estimated even when only short historical series of demographic data are available.},

  title={National Population Growth Rate, Its Components, and Subnational Contributions: A Research Note},
  author={Canudas-Romo, Vladimir and Shen, Tianyu and Payne, Collin F.},
  abstract={A population's current growth rate is determined jointly by changes in fertility, mortality, and migration. This overall growth rate is also the average of age-specific growth rates, which can be decomposed into the result of historical changes in fertility, mortality, and migration. However, doing so requires more than 100 years of historical data, meaning that such analyses are possible only in a select few populations. In this research note, we propose an adapted version of the variable-r model to measure contributions to the population growth rate for countries with shorter demographic series. In addition, we extend this model to explore the contribution of subnational changes to the national population growth rate. Our results demonstrate that the age-specific growth rates obtained from short historical series, say 25 years, closely match those of the longer series. These abbreviated age-specific growth rates closely resemble the growth rate at birth of their respective cohorts, which is the major determinant of population growth, except at older ages where mortality becomes the main explanatory element. Exploring subnational populations, we find considerable heterogeneity in the age profile of the components of growth and find that the most populous regions tend to have an outsized impact on national-level growth.},
