  title={Decomposition of Differentials in Health Expectancies From Multistate Life Tables: A Research Note},
  author={Shen, Tianyu and Riffe, Tim and Payne, Collin F. and Canudas-Romo, Vladimir},
  abstract={Multistate modeling is a commonly used method to compute healthy life expectancy. However, there is currently no analytical method to decompose the components of differentials in summary measures calculated from multistate models. In this research note, we propose a derivative-based method to decompose the differentials in population-based health expectancies estimated via a multistate model into two main components: the proportion resulting from differences in initial health structure and the proportion resulting from differences in health transitions. We illustrate the method using data on activities of daily living from the U.S. Health and Retirement Study to decompose the sex differential in disability-free life expectancy (HLE) among older Americans. Our results suggest that the sex gap in HLE results primarily from differences in transition rates between disability states rather than from the initial health distribution of female and male populations. The methods introduced here will enable researchers, including those working in fields other than health, to decompose the relative contribution of initial population structure and transition probabilities to differences in state-specific life expectancies from multistate models.},

  title={The estimation of age and sex profiles for international migration amongst countries in the Asia-Pacific region},
  author={Shen, Tianyu and Raymer, J. and Qing, G. and Wiśniowski, A.},
  abstract={Information on the age and sex patterns of international migration occurring amongst countries in the Asia-Pacific region is important for researchers and policymakers to understand the contributions of migration towards demographic, economic and social changes. However, despite its importance, statistics on the age and sex patterns are largely absent and, where they do exist, there are considerable differences in measurement and data collection procedures. In this study, we develop a methodology for indirectly estimating the age and sex patterns of international migration for 53 populations in the Asia-Pacific region and four macroworld regions. Multiplicative component models are used to systematically combine information from multiple data sources and infer missing data, resulting in complete and harmonised tables of migration by origin, destination, age, and sex from 2000 to 2019. The estimates are presented and assessed with some discussions on how they may be applied and further improved.},

  title={Disability and morbidity among US birth cohorts, 1998–2018: A multidimensional test of dynamic equilibrium theory},
  author={Shen, Tianyu and Payne, Collin},
  abstract={A substantial body of prior research has explored patterns of disability-free and morbidity-free life expectancy among older populations. However, these distinct facets of later-life health are almost always studied in isolation, even though they are very likely to be related. Using data from the US Health and Retirement Study and a multistate life table approach, this paper explores the interactions between disability, morbidity, and mortality by sex and education among four successive US birth cohorts, born from 1914 to 1923 to 1944–1953 and compared in the periods 1998–2008 and 2008–2018. We find little compression of disability but a marked expansion of morbidity across cohorts. However, disability-free life expectancy (DFLE) among those living with chronic morbidities has increased, even though at the population-level DFLE is largely unchanged. Broadly, these patterns suggest that successive cohorts of older populations in the US are experiencing a dynamic equilibrium, where the link between chronic morbidities and disability has weakened over successive cohorts. Investigating patterns by educational attainment, we find marked disparities where the least educated individuals not only live significantly fewer years free of disabilities or chronic morbidities but also have experienced an expansion in morbidity and disability. Our findings suggest that the future trajectory of disability-free life expectancy in the US is increasingly contingent on efforts to improve disease management and control the severe consequences of chronic morbidities.},
