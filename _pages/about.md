I'm a postdoc researcher in the VID. I completed his doctoral degree in 2025 at the Australian National University with the dissertation on “Living Longer and Healthier? An Advancement of Methodology and Understanding on Health Expectancy”. My project centres on the analysis of **social inequalities in health** and **multistate models** to capture population dynamics.
