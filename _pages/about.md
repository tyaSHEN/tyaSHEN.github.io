I'm a Ph.D. student in the School of Demography at the Australian National University. My project centres on the analysis of **social inequalities in health** in the Asia Pacific region and **the development of multistate models** to capture population dynamics. 

I completed the Master of Social Research in 2020 at the ANU and has since been a research assistance in the School of Demography. I was involved in multiple projects including “State Population Projections Model for the Centre for Population”, “ACT Treasury population projections”, “Overcoming the problems of inconsistent migration data in the Asia Pacific” and "ACT School enrollment projection".
